# DryBeanClassification
This project classifies dry beans using machine learning. Data was preprocessed, encoded, and split into train-test sets. XGBoost performed best (Train Acc: 99.83%, Test Acc: 91.51%), followed by Random Forest. Decision Tree showed overfitting, while SVC &amp; KNN underperformed. Future improvements include hyperparameter tuning and feature selection.
